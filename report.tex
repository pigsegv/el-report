\begin{abstract}
These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for
IEEE Access. Use this document as a template if you are
using \LaTeX. Otherwise, use this document as an
instruction set. The electronic file of your paper will be formatted further
at IEEE. Paper titles should be written in uppercase and lowercase letters,
not all uppercase. Avoid writing long formulas with subscripts in the title;
short formulas that identify the elements are fine (e.g., "Nd--Fe--B"). Do
not write ``(Invited)'' in the title. Full names of authors are preferred in
the author field, but are not required. Put a space between authors'
initials. The abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of
what is in your article. In particular, the abstract must be self-contained,
without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of
the full article. The abstract must be between 150--250 words. Be sure that
you adhere to these limits; otherwise, you will need to edit your abstract
accordingly. The abstract must be written as one paragraph, and should not
contain displayed mathematical equations or tabular material. The abstract
should include three or four different keywords or phrases, as this will
help readers to find it. It is important to avoid over-repetition of such
phrases as this can result in a page being rejected by search engines.
Ensure that your abstract reads well and is grammatically correct.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\PARstart{R}{apid} urbanization has led to extensive construction of impervious 
surfaces such as asphalt and conventional concrete pavements, which disrupt the 
natural hydrological cycle. These surfaces prevent water infiltration, resulting 
in increased surface runoff, urban flooding, and reduced groundwater recharge. 
In response to these environmental concerns, there has been a growing interest 
in sustainable construction materials that support stormwater management. One 
such material is pervious concrete, a special type of concrete with a high void 
content that allows water to pass through its structure. 

Pervious concrete is composed of coarse aggregates, cement, water, and little to 
no fine aggregates. Its interconnected pore network enables infiltration of 
rainwater, making it suitable for sidewalks, parking lots, driveways, and 
low-traffic roads. In addition to hydrological benefits, pervious concrete can 
reduce the urban heat island effect, improve skid resistance, and contribute 
toward LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) credits in green 
building certification systems. 

Despite its advantages, the widespread use of pervious concrete has been limited 
due to challenges in achieving an optimal balance between permeability and 
mechanical strength. In this study, we focus on the effects of the  water-cement 
ratio on the physical properties of pervious concrete. To this end, two batches 
of 6 pervious concrete cylinders, with the second batch having a lower 
water-cement ratio, were made, and tested for compresssive strength, split 
tensile strength, and permeability. Superplasticizer (SP) was used to increase 
the workability of the mixes made with the second recipe. 



\section{Experimental Setup}
Two batches of 6 cylinders each were cast. Common to both batches were the
cementitious material which was a mixture of cement and fly-ash in the ratio of 
4:1 by mass, coarse aggregates whose sizes ranged from 4.75-9.5 mm, 
and polypropylene fibres (PPF).

The rest of the ingredients are given in table \ref{table:mix-design}.

\section{Testing Method}
The samples were tested after 14 and 28 days for tensile and compressive 
strenghts, and after 28 days for permeability.

\subsection{Compressive Strength}
The sample was placed in the universal testing machine (UTM) on one of its 
circular faces, and compressed. The pace rate was set to 1.8 KN/s. 
The compressive strength $f_c$ is calculated with the formula 
\[f_c = \frac{P}{A}\] where $P$ is the maximum force on the sample, and $A$ is
the area over which the force is applied.

\subsection{Tensile Strength}
The tensile strength was found using the Brazilian test, in which, the sample
was placed horizontally, in between two metal bars oriented parallel to the axis
of the sample, inside the UTM. The tensile strength $f_t$ was calculated with
the formula \[f_t = \frac{2P}{\pi LD}\] where $P$ is the force at the point of
failure, and $L$ and $D$ are respectively the length and the diameter of the
sample.



\section{Some Common Mistakes}
The word ``data'' is plural, not singular. The subscript for the
permeability of vacuum $\mu _{0}$ is zero, not a lowercase letter
``o.'' The term for residual magnetization is ``remanence''; the adjective
is ``remanent''; do not write ``remnance'' or ``remnant.'' Use the word
``micrometer'' instead of ``micron.'' A graph within a graph is an
``inset,'' not an ``insert.'' The word ``alternatively'' is preferred to the
word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates). Use
the word ``whereas'' instead of ``while'' (unless you are referring to
simultaneous events). Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean
``approximately'' or ``effectively.'' Do not use the word ``issue'' as a
euphemism for ``problem.'' When compositions are not specified, separate
chemical symbols by en-dashes; for example, ``NiMn'' indicates the
intermetallic compound Ni$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$ whereas
``Ni--Mn'' indicates an alloy of some composition
Ni$_{x}$Mn$_{1-x}$.

Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' (usually a
verb) and ``effect'' (usually a noun), ``complement'' and ``compliment,''
``discreet'' and ``discrete,'' ``principal'' (e.g., ``principal
investigator'') and ``principle'' (e.g., ``principle of measurement''). Do
not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer.''

Prefixes such as ``non,'' ``sub,'' ``micro,'' ``multi,'' and ``ultra'' are
not independent words; they should be joined to the words they modify,
usually without a hyphen. There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin
abbreviation ``\emph{et al.}'' (it is also italicized). The abbreviation ``i.e.,'' means
``that is,'' and the abbreviation ``e.g.,'' means ``for example'' (these
abbreviations are not italicized).

\section{Guidelines for Graphics Preparation and Submission}
\label{sec:guidelines}

\subsection{Types of Graphics}
The following list outlines the different types of graphics published in
IEEE journals. They are categorized based on their construction, and use of
color/shades of gray:

\subsubsection{Color/Grayscale figures}
{Figures that are meant to appear in color, or shades of black/gray. Such
figures may include photographs, illustrations, multicolor graphs, and
flowcharts. For multicolor graphs, please avoid any gray backgrounds or shading, as well as screenshots, instead export the graph from the program used to collect the data.}

\subsubsection{Line Art figures}
{Figures that are composed of only black lines and shapes. These figures
should have no shades or half-tones of gray, only black and white.}

\subsubsection{Author photos}
{Author photographs should be included with the author biographies located at the end of the article underneath References. }

\subsubsection{Tables}
{Data charts which are typically black and white, but sometimes include
color.}

\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{table}

\subsection{Multipart figures}
Figures compiled of more than one sub-figure presented side-by-side, or
stacked. If a multipart figure is made up of multiple figure
types (one part is lineart, and another is grayscale or color) the figure
should meet the stricter guidelines.

\subsection{File Formats For Graphics}\label{formats}
Format and save your graphics using a suitable graphics processing program
that will allow you to create the images as PostScript (.PS), Encapsulated
PostScript (.EPS), Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF), Portable Document
Format (.PDF), Portable Network Graphics (.PNG), or Metapost (.MPS), sizes them, and adjusts
the resolution settings. When
submitting your final paper, your graphics should all be submitted
individually in one of these formats along with the manuscript.

\subsection{Sizing of Graphics}
Most charts, graphs, and tables are one column wide (3.5 inches/88
millimeters/21 picas) or page wide (7.16 inches/181 millimeters/43
picas). The maximum depth a graphic can be is 8.5 inches (216 millimeters/54
picas). When choosing the depth of a graphic, please allow space for a
caption. Figures can be sized between column and page widths if the author
chooses, however it is recommended that figures are not sized less than
column width unless when necessary.

There is currently one publication with column measurements that do not
coincide with those listed above. Proceedings of the IEEE has a column
measurement of 3.25 inches (82.5 millimeters/19.5 picas).

The final printed size of author photographs is exactly
1 inch wide by 1.25 inches tall (25.4 millimeters$\,\times\,$31.75 millimeters/6
picas$\,\times\,$7.5 picas). Author photos printed in editorials measure 1.59 inches
wide by 2 inches tall (40 millimeters$\,\times\,$50 millimeters/9.5 picas$\,\times\,$12
picas).

\subsection{Resolution }
The proper resolution of your figures will depend on the type of figure it
is as defined in the ``Types of Figures'' section. Author photographs,
color, and grayscale figures should be at least 300dpi. Line art, including
tables should be a minimum of 600dpi.

\subsection{Vector Art}
In order to preserve the figures' integrity across multiple computer
platforms, we accept files in the following formats: .EPS/.PDF/.PS. All
fonts must be embedded or text converted to outlines in order to achieve the
best-quality results.

\subsection{Color Space}
The term color space refers to the entire sum of colors that can be
represented within the said medium. For our purposes, the three main color
spaces are Grayscale, RGB (red/green/blue) and CMYK
(cyan/magenta/yellow/black). RGB is generally used with on-screen graphics,
whereas CMYK is used for printing purposes.

All color figures should be generated in RGB or CMYK color space. Grayscale
images should be submitted in Grayscale color space. Line art may be
provided in grayscale OR bitmap colorspace. Note that ``bitmap colorspace''
and ``bitmap file format'' are not the same thing. When bitmap color space
is selected, .TIF/.TIFF/.PNG are the recommended file formats.

\subsection{Accepted Fonts Within Figures}
When preparing your graphics IEEE suggests that you use of one of the
following Open Type fonts: Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, Cambria, and
Symbol. If you are supplying EPS, PS, or PDF files all fonts must be
embedded. Some fonts may only be native to your operating system; without
the fonts embedded, parts of the graphic may be distorted or missing.

A safe option when finalizing your figures is to strip out the fonts before
you save the files, creating ``outline'' type. This converts fonts to
artwork what will appear uniformly on any screen.

\subsection{Using Labels Within Figures}

\subsubsection{Figure Axis labels }
Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than
symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,'' or
``Magnetization M,'' not just ``M.'' Put units in parentheses. Do not label
axes only with units. As in Fig. 1, for example, write ``Magnetization
(A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A$\cdot$m$^{-1}$),'' not just ``A/m.'' Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and
units. For example, write ``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or
``Magnetization (10$^{3}$ A/m).'' Do not write ``Magnetization
(A/m)$\,\times\,$1000'' because the reader would not know whether the top
axis label in Fig. 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be
legible, approximately 8 to 10 point type.

\subsubsection{Subfigure Labels in Multipart Figures and Tables}
Multipart figures should be combined and labeled before final submission.
Labels should appear centered below each subfigure in 8 point Times New
Roman font in the format of (a) (b) (c).

\subsection{File Naming}
Figures (line artwork or photographs) should be named starting with the
first 5 letters of the author's last name. The next characters in the
filename should be the number that represents the sequential
location of this image in your article. For example, in author
``Anderson's'' paper, the first three figures would be named ander1.tif,
ander2.tif, and ander3.ps.

Tables should contain only the body of the table (not the caption) and
should be named similarly to figures, except that `.t' is inserted
in-between the author's name and the table number. For example, author
Anderson's first three tables would be named ander.t1.tif, ander.t2.ps,
ander.t3.eps.

Author photographs should be named using the first five characters of the
pictured author's last name. For example, four author photographs for a
paper may be named: oppen.ps, moshc.tif, chen.eps, and duran.pdf.

If two authors or more have the same last name, their first initial(s) can
be substituted for the fifth, fourth, third$\ldots$ letters of their surname
until the degree where there is differentiation. For example, two authors
Michael and Monica Oppenheimer's photos would be named oppmi.tif, and
oppmo.eps.

\subsection{Referencing a Figure or Table Within Your Paper}
When referencing your figures and tables within your paper, use the
abbreviation ``Fig.'' even at the beginning of a sentence. Figures should be numbered with Arabic Numerals.
Do not abbreviate ``Table.'' Tables should be numbered with Roman Numerals.

\subsection{Submitting Your Graphics}
Figures should be submitted individually, separate from the manuscript in one of the file formats listed above in Section IV-C. Place figure captions below the figures; place table titles above the tables. Please do not include captions as part of the figures, or put them in ‘‘text boxes’’ linked to the figures. Also, do not place borders around the outside of your figures.

\subsection{Color Processing/Printing in IEEE Journals}
All IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters allow an author to publish
color figures on IEEE {\it Xplore}$\circledR$\ at no charge, and automatically
convert them to grayscale for print versions. In most journals, figures and
tables may alternatively be printed in color if an author chooses to do so.
Please note that this service comes at an extra expense to the author. If
you intend to have print color graphics, include a note with your final
paper indicating which figures or tables you would like to be handled that
way, and stating that you are willing to pay the additional fee.

\section{Conclusion}
Although a conclusion may review the  main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A
conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest
applications and extensions.

If you have multiple appendices, use the $\backslash$appendices command below. If you have only one appendix, use
$\backslash$appendix[Appendix Title]

\appendices
\section{\break Footnotes}
Number footnotes separately in superscript numbers.\footnote{It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for
the unnumbered footnote with the receipt date on the first page). Instead,
try to integrate the footnote information into the text.} Place the actual
footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put
footnotes in the reference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes
(see Table \ref{table}).

\section{\break Submitting Your Paper for Review}

\subsection{Final Stage}
When your article is accepted, you can submit the final files, including figures, tables, and photos, per the journal's guidelines through the submission system used to submit the articlle.
 You may use \emph{Zip} for large files, or compress files using \emph{Compress, Pkzip, Stuffit,} or \emph{Gzip.}

In addition, designate one author as the ``corresponding author.'' This is the author to
whom proofs of the paper will be sent. Proofs are sent to the corresponding
author only.

\subsection{Review Stage Using IEEE Author Portal}
Article contributions to IEEE Access should be submitted electronically on the IEEE Author Portal. For more information, please visit
\underline{https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/}.

Along with other information, you will be asked to select the subject from a
pull-down list. There are various steps to the
submission process; you must complete all steps for a complete submission.
At the end of each step you must click ``Save and Continue''; just uploading
the paper is not sufficient. After the last step, you should see a
confirmation that the submission is complete. You should also receive an
e-mail confirmation. For inquiries regarding the submission of your article, please contact ieeeaccess@ieee.org.

The manuscript should be prepared in a double column, single-spaced format using a required IEEE Access template.
A Word or LaTeX file and a PDF file are both required upon submission in the IEEE Author Portal.

\subsection{Final Stage Using IEEE Author Portal}
Upon acceptance, you will receive an email with specific instructions

Designate the author who submitted the manuscript on
IEEE Author Portal as the ``corresponding author.'' This is the only
author to whom proofs of the paper will be sent.

\subsection{Copyright Form}
Authors must submit an electronic IEEE Copyright Form (eCF) upon submitting
their final manuscript files. You can access the eCF system through your
manuscript submission system or through the Author Gateway. You are
responsible for obtaining any necessary approvals and/or security
clearances. For additional information on intellectual property rights,
visit the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights department web page at
\underline{http://www.ieee.org/publications\_standards/publications/}\break\underline{rights/index.html}.

\section{\break IEEE Publishing Policy}
The general IEEE policy requires that authors should only submit original
work that has neither appeared elsewhere for publication, nor is under
review for another refereed publication. The submitting author must disclose
all prior publication(s) and current submissions when submitting a
manuscript. Do not publish ``preliminary'' data or results. To avoid any delays in
publication, please be sure to follow these instructions.  Final
submissions should include source files of your accepted manuscript, high
quality graphic files, and a formatted pdf file. If you have any questions
regarding the final submission process, please contact the administrative
contact for the journal.
author is responsible for obtaining agreement of all coauthors and any
consent required from employers or sponsors before submitting an article.

The IEEE Access Editorial Office does not publish conference
records or proceedings, but can publish articles related to conferences that
have undergone rigorous peer review. Minimally, two reviews are required for
every article submitted for peer review.

\section{\break Publication Principles}
Authors should consider the following points:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Technical papers submitted for publication must advance the state of knowledge and must cite relevant prior work.
\item The length of a submitted paper should be commensurate with the importance, or appropriate to the complexity, of the work. For example, an obvious extension of previously published work might not be appropriate for publication or might be adequately treated in just a few pages.
\item Authors must convince both peer reviewers and the editors of the scientific and technical merit of a paper; the standards of proof are higher when extraordinary or unexpected results are reported.
\item Because replication is required for scientific progress, papers submitted for publication must provide sufficient information to allow readers to perform similar experiments or calculations and
use the reported results. Although not everything need be disclosed, a paper
must contain new, useable, and fully described information. For example, a
specimen's chemical composition need not be reported if the main purpose of
a paper is to introduce a new measurement technique. Authors should expect
to be challenged by reviewers if the results are not supported by adequate
data and critical details.
\item Papers that describe ongoing work or announce the latest technical achievement, which are suitable for presentation at a professional conference, may not be appropriate for publication.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Acknowledgment}
The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is
without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Use the singular heading even if you have
many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would
like to thank $\ldots$ .'' Instead, write ``F. A. Author thanks $\ldots$ .'' In most
cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the
unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.
